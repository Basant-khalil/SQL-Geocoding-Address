# Google Geocoding API: Address Parsing and More
Welcome to the Google Geocoding API project! The main objective of this personal project is to efficiently parse addresses from free text input and convert them into formatted addresses that consist of crucial details such as street number, route, city, state, zipcode, and country.

## What is Google Geocoding API?
The Google Geocoding API is a powerful tool that provides latitude/longitude coordinates and standardized address information. With this API, you can perform various tasks including address validation, real-time mapping of user-entered addresses, distance calculations, and much more.


## API Keys
While Google allows anonymous access to its API, it's important to note that rate limits may apply. If you find yourself exceeding these limits, you will need to sign up for a new Server API Key to continue using the API seamlessly.

MapQuest API is another valuable resource for address parsing and related functionalities, but it does require a key. You can sign up for a key on their official website: [MapQuest API](http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open).

Google allows anonymous access to it's API, but if you start hitting rate limits, you must [sign up for a new Server API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key).

Bing [requires an API key](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx) to access its service.

You will need a [consumer secret and consumer key](http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/BOSS_Signup.pdf) (PDF) for Yahoo.

## Address Distribution by Country
To give you an idea of the scale and reach of this project, here's a breakdown of the number of addresses available for parsing in various countries:

| Country        | Number of Addresses           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| US      | 4602 		 |
| GB      | 757      |
| HK      | 266      |
